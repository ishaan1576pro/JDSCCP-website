    <h1><p> About us </p></h1>
    <p>1) We are a small group of students trying to eshtablish communism in our school</p>
    <p>2) Some of us are members of SFI(Student federation of India), We support the CPI(M) political party and the left front as a whole</p>
    <p>3) We are not exactly communists, socialism is a more appropiate term to describe us</p>
    <p>4) In the current Russo-Ukrainian war, we support the workers and soldiers of both sides who are devoting their life for their countries, but at a same time we are more leaned towards Russia as they are india's most important ally and ukraine has many neo-nazi divisions</p>

      <i><p>Our goal:
        We already spent more than half of our school life, and we noticed one thing, since the start of our school life, that is partiality. Always the children of teachers would be given more priority, christans would get more priority, not to forget the teachers pets. Whom the teachers would always belive. We, the common students, were suppresed. One false complain from the teachers pet would give us a detention, no one would even bother to check the CCTV.
        BUT FOR HOW LONG WILL THIS CONTINUE? WE NEED AN END TO IT! WE NEED AN END TO PARTIALITY AND NEPOTISM! WE WANT COMMUNISM!!
